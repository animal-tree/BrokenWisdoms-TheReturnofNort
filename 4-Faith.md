Message about preferring to die than legal action

> Date: **10/30/23**

Screenshot

I almost said “It makes me want to die” in the [mass email of 10/30/23](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md#email-10302023). Thankfully a friend in a group chat of several people suggested otherwise, or else the University of Rochester might’ve been responsible for doing another coerced hospitalization of me, and a repeat of the cycle of unforeseen consequences from involuntary interventions on me. Either way, however, they could have *plausibly* been responsible for a student and worker's suicide.

### Enemies

Rewind to August, before the six-month review deadline and after I was notified of my stipend and advisor-cut. I took my best friend into this, asking for his advice on an email that I sent, and stating my plans (or lackthereof) regarding legal action:

</br>We were discussing [this email (of 08/10/23)](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md).

I sent them this email exactly as I showed my friend. That was the best I was able to phrase everything (for whatever reason, perhaps due to revisiting the trauma, my consciousness and my corresponding linguistics weren't in the best state). All of what had gone on was conveyed to them as early as the beginning of August, at least as much as could be summarized in less than a book. Following which, here is how my best friend and I discussed it afterwards:

## Right to talk about suicide seriously

Most people seriously considering suicide can't talk about it, not unless they bury the very-conscious awareness of the standard policy of hospitalization and drugging. The more seriously somebody genuinely needs to talk about their depression amid a genine imminent plan, the less they legally can without risking the security of their plan. One of the points of Right To Die, to start with, is to legalize suicide-plan therapy.

It's also to increase peace of mind for people with severe depression, by giving them an exit door from Hell, not an exit push. Borrowing Sartre's depiction of the current state of human relationships, we have both that "Hell is other people" and, as the play is called: [No Exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit). Besides giving people the ability to talk about suicide ideation without the threat of being hospitalized and coercively drugged, Right To Die also guarantees some peace of mind, enough for people going through unbelievable trauma to possibly relax, with some security, to regain a sense of optimism to pursue with their life. 

With Right To Die, bodies of suicide victims don't have to splatter from buildings, or in front of locomotives, or from bullet wounds on the walls that witnesses arrive to. Other methods require research ability and skill to carry out singlehandedly. Yet other methods can cause permanent damage to brain or body, reducing life quality even more, at no benefit except to our pride as a society for being able to say pompously and wrongly, "Yep, we sure saved that life."

> [!NOTE]
> I don't have the morale to elaborate on how "art made tongue-tied by authority and folly, doctor-like controlling skill" is relevant. I worked under Chenliang and the university's arbitrations as "captive good attending to captain evil." With ideas that were intuitive and ahead of their time dismissed and disregarded. "Simple truth miscall'd simplicity." And indeed, "doctor-like" controlling skill is the analogy Shakespeare turned to, to describe the kind of authority that governs most of the university. "And strength by limping sway disabled," as I literally limp to walk from the eczema on my legs, currently caused by the stress of describing their insanity in order to write this book.

> My mom told me the Russian translation of this sonnet translates the last line to mean, that there is somebody in the narrator's life, for him, for whom he still has reason to live.
>
> "Tired with all these, from these would I be gone, save that, to die, I leave my love alone."
>
> And that might be the interpretation, but I sense that's not the one Shakespeare most meant. My interpretation might end up even more controversial than this chapter of this book, really, since a lot of people perhaps want to interpret a romantic notion at the end (my mom knows Shakespeare didn't mean it maternally). However, that would be a pretty big thematic divergence and betrayal, if after every line (from "purest faith unhappily forsworn" to "maiden virtue rudely strumpeted"), Shakespeare's meaning coalesced to, "Well, I could never do that to my girlfriend." Not to man-splain what Shakespeare meant, but this is what Shakespeare meant ("sam-splaining" is a distinct form):
>
> The narrator referred to himself as a "beggar born," and he cries for death so as to behold himself "desert" from himself, meaning to "leave" himself (to die) and "leave" all of the tragedies listed thereafter. The last line is exactly parallel to this in meaning. He refers to his love: "I leave *my* love" — his literal, un-metaphorical love — "alone." To leave his love is leaving his body. It's leaving his skin. It's leaving his emotion. Shakespeare is expressing that the immense love within the narrator that he's expressed in the verses of this sonnet, does not deserve the injustice of being escaped alone. Jokingly, one could even interpret he'd rather take you all with him. Perhaps the simplest possible interpretation of the word "love" will be called "simplicity" by academics. The un-metaphorical meaning, the literal one — love — is the meaning I think Shakespeare most meant.
>
> When a person dies, they don't just leave their life. They leave the constellations of beauty inside them, including all of their love; and this sonnet expresses a tragedy, of someone who has so much love and passion — and it's wasted.
>
> Another interpretation is that his love is tied to a soulmate, one he hasn't met yet, someone in the future who he will love, guaranteed to him by the stars. I like that interpretation, too, but it's out of context for what the narrator is primarily conveying in this specific sonnet, the injustice of the world that leads the narrator, through Shakespeare's words, to cry for death.
>
> Every other interpretation, besides this literal one, is wrong in some way that I can specify if they're listed. In short, they diverge from the commentary of the sonnet and undermine the narrator's struggle.

Here is an excerpt from my own suicide note that I'd written, trying to describe what my last moments hypothetically would've been, as I inferred from my practice rounds of trying to go through with it:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> [...]
> 
> Another concern is thoughts of doubt. For example, I might remember how much comfort my mom brings me and that the comfort she offers is still available tomorrow. I might even feel guilty for taking such drastic actions under the wing of such availability of comfort. I think that’s the strongest argument, and the hardest to stay resolved in.
>
> I might remember my grandma, and the injustice that this has fallen on her grandson.
>
> But then I can maybe find peace in those thoughts. Maybe I can imagine my mom and grandma, and grandpa, and all those people who loved me and made me, and love — present tense — in the case of my mom, and find peace in knowing they want my pain to end. That they are not judging me for my exit, and support my escape from this hellhole.
>
> Then I can [method redacted] and try not to think of all the strangers who tainted this world for me. Try to remain meditated on the thought that my family — my mom, my uncle — are good. The world has heart in it. 
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$ 

That's how the note ended. Note: My mom didn't know my suicide plan. Nobody knew I was going to do it, and how seriously I meant to. However, I did talk to my therapist, through completely abstract rhetoric — since anything other than abstract philosophical rhetoric would've risked another coercive hospitalization and drugging — about Right To Die. I talked to him philosophically, but that's not the kind of serious expression I mean should be possible. Not everybody can transmute their emotions into philosophy, or write a Shakespeare sonnet, everytime they want to communicate something, nor did that help me. Those words, expressed literally and seriously, not just as philosophy or art, but in the words that a person has available to them everyday, shouldn't have institutional coercion, including coercive hospitalization and drugging, as the threat for their speaking.

Here is what I can say from personal experience, having an elaborate plan and method (one that I can always eventually take up, in case coercive hospitals think they have a chance at helping me again): The option to die is agony-relieving. Taking it away contributes to suicide ideation. Furthermore, speaking from past personal experience and the reality that is proven: keeping it illegal can lead to gruesome methods being resorted to that lack dignity, but for some people become the only method they know they can turn to to escape suffering. The peaceful version, via Right To Die, is a healing right for somebody to have within their own choice, for their own life. I don't want to extend a political slogan beyond its intended meaning, but My Body, My Choice is true. A society’s responsibility is to negotiate for the lives of the people who inhabit it — not a person's to give what's left of theirs suffering — not to mention inexpressibly — within an unjust society.

At the very least, Right To Talk About Suicide Without Hospitalization, Drugging, Or Police Action should be legalized (or rather, standardized).

## Synchronicities

Meanwhile, before and after, astonishing [synchronicities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity) happened that can be listed below and I leave for your judgement on their metaphysical or coincidental nature.

### Chris Kanan (Deus ex memory)

- Indeed, my faith regarding sending my sincere description of the traumas, despite the difficulty of doing so, was somewhat rewarded, though probably not by their conscious intent, rather by a lucky [“Deus Ex Memory”](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md), wherein one of the 3 committee members (accidentally) recorded to official record that he really-extraordinarily didn’t remember the details of the meeting on which their termination was based.
- Following this [“Deus Ex Memory”](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) exchange with Chris Kanan, I had yet another reply I wanted to send afterwards that would’ve ruined the conclusive punctuation of the previous, and by chance my internet went down or some disruption to the internet happened after hitting send and I was really lucky that it didn’t go through, leaving this exchange on the note of “we all know what just happened,” and a strong discredit to the committee's judgement-making, thoughtfulness, and memory.
- This is the same Chris Kanan who gave the [one and only concrete research suggestion](), which I ended up following [exceptionally and on proven GitHub record]() before the termination decisions, and didn't just get no credit, but also the judgement that I “refused to follow” committee advice as the justification for the termination decision, despite the advice being disproportionately hard and intense (“invent a new RL systems algorithm before the next meeting”, [paraphrasing]()), and having done it quite extraordinarily really via a novel accelerated parallel priority experience replay with sampling-without-replacement algorithm with memory-mapping, and truly-shared RAM. There was nothing like it, still isn’t, and it’s by far the best RL implementation of experience replay and adjacent sampling algorithms, as well as being novel as an algorithm itself via the sampling-without-replacement, which I described to my advisor’s satisfaction in literally the meeting in which he next notified me of my stipend and advisor-cut, since that was his intent for the meeting.
- The theme of memory is a big coincidence in itself since what I implemented was a large-scale, dynamically growable, rewritable, truly shared RAM and adaptive memory-mapping across devices parallelized lifelong replay memory. [TO DO: Stress this way more]
- I never met Chris Kanan in person and my advisor suggested him as one of the last-minute replacement committee members. Note: I don't think he should be punished for this. I think whatever powers-that-be that regulate his consciousness proved stronger than the ones that facilitate the atmosphere/landscape of the formal University of Rochester, and did good amid impossible programming.

### Jordan Peterson

My benzo trauma was with a [comparatively](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/10091/benzodiazepine-conversion-calculator) higher dose than what Jordan Peterson took (he took approximately 12% - 80% the dose I did, and that's when I was taking them at the lowest dose the psychiatrists had reduced to), and preceded the situation Mikhaila Peterson, his daughter, described ([originally on her channel](https://youtu.be/lwXHZvyGmRU?si=_1C7x2LY7pCETyAA)), about how the professional psychoanalyst was caught off guard by the severe damages that the drugs caused, wherein he took [0.5 mg](https://ashnavabi.com/2022/01/19/jordan-peterson-was-not-addicted-to-benzos/) of [Clonazepam](https://windwardway.com/rehab-blog/jordan-peterson-finishes-lengthy-treatment-for-addiction/) per day as prescribed, reportedly, and unlike him I didn’t have the entire Russian army brigade bringing me into health (he went to Russia, where they were the first to have the medicine and specialized treatment to help him).

### Mikhaila Peterson

Prior to that, by coincidence, his daughter Mikhaila (thankfully) recommended the steak-only diet (for an independent thing), which is where I heard it from, a clip from her podcast. That’s a global-level synchronicity involving them that happened after I was put through all of this crisis, which contributed to bringing me out, as well as my hair growing back, thanks to her diet recommendation.

I finished making this [benzo-timeline diagram](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/497f6d9b-ff12-4e6a-97c5-e5230c05e505) just as Pink Floyd's [Comfortably Numb](https://youtu.be/_FrOQC-zEog?si=riY-TNigVjimQ_iT) started playing on my Spotify's radio on shuffle, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was Psycho Killer which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar). Not bad. Rgearding Whiskey Bar, any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Lily to Elliott Smith for the first time in the hospital with the song [Between the Bars](https://youtu.be/2FmYzACF-kg?si=DLaBako9OolIYuVx) (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars, though Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them) while we were in the hospital (linguistically like: between the bars of confinement). It was the only song I thought to show her in the one situation when we were allowed to pick our own music, and she remembered and liked it. Also coincidentally, she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there. While some of these are clearly just linguistic, the timing of [Comfortably Numb](https://youtu.be/_FrOQC-zEog?si=riY-TNigVjimQ_iT) and the next two songs seems worth noting since many people, like Lily and myself, appreciate synchronicities. Two more: (1) speaking of timing, the [diagram](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/497f6d9b-ff12-4e6a-97c5-e5230c05e505) is about a chronology (not of songs, but of benzo trauma), and (2) Lily’s last name is phonetically pronounced "Jung," the depth psychologist who coined synchronicities.

### CMT deletion of record

CMT (the portal that was used to submit to the "NIPS" 2018 conference, today called NeurIPS) deleted their record of my MHDPA innovation paper, the one that foretold ChatGPT to my university's professors (or tried to), the same month when I was terminated (CMT’s deleting of that record at around that time can be verified, since they sent out a notification email on 10/20/23 to everybody that they were updating their data retention policy). But in 2018, the paper was sent out to Henry Kautz and Daniel Gildea by email, and submitted to the class as that class’s end of semester project also via email. So the digital record does remain to verify the paper and its being written in 2018 with the first initial successful experiments, and email record of Henry and Dan's respective advice on how to mathematically or linguistically describe MHDPA, claiming more math was needed and that “relational reasoning” is the wrong term (though what I had and stuck with is now the convention, and already had some precedent then). That’s not to insult Henry or Dan. There’s also clear record that, most deep learning and natural language processing researchers, even outside of the University of Rochester, [weren't too abundantly "foretelling" of MHDPA's importance](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=mhdpa&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&as_ylo=2017&as_yhi=2018) (the link is to two papers that were, the earliest papers to use MHDPA at all, also from 2018, and others that just directly referenced it) at the time of my paper. Both of those two papers used MHDPA for something fundamentally new, but neither innovated directly on MHDPA, meaning mine was probably the first to do so, ever. While I was finishing up the code for my MHDPA innovation in Montreal during NeurIPS (called "NIPS" at the time) 2018, I met one of the authors of [one of those two papers](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/e2eabaf96372e20a9e3d4b5f83723a61-Abstract.html), Ryan Faulkner, and we got lunch and he said he'd recommend me to a position at DeepMind (he was miraculously impressed with me). 

And not only foretold to my university's professors, but innovated on and executed successful experiments verifying the early innovation — and formal paper submission, later derailed by me having to switch advisors, fields, and put on deadlines, not to mention all of their doubt, skepticism, and lack of enthsuiasm (oh but enthusiasm came later when MHDPA exploded, with Henry even telling me on email record, after he was no longer my advisor, that I should work on vision transformers!).

### Sam "Altman"

The head of OpenAI, the company that invented ChatGPT (that used MHDPA), whose name is "Sam Altman" (mine is Sam Lerman) — "Altman," which is not German Ashkenazi for "teacher" — was terminated as the head of OpenAI in an unusually sensationalized situation exactly 17 days after my termination as PhD student, then was brought back.

They were working on some AGI project called Q*, and the synchronicity may have been meant to give me hope, but [it didn't](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/Synchronicity-Paranoias.md).

### Michael Scott’s paper factory

Michael’s name [is mockable](https://youtu.be/ZPKdJGY0YyE?si=ja-odwAD_z7G98ZK). 

But from the age of three and two thirds, until 11th grade, as a result of the Uzbek mistranslation when we moved, mine used to be much more mockable. 

As I described to my friend: 

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> These quotes express that I am writing something, but i am aware that this writing is in quotes. Therefore do the quotes bias their own measurement of what is being written? I think so. Lest this paragraph thus far would not be entirely about the quotes.
>
> Anyway, I'm thinking about "Sam" - the name. Did you know, \<friend's name\>, (okay apparently this is a targeted-audience writing-prompt), that my name was Semen until 11th grade? This is new information to you as far as I can recall, but a major part of the story of my life. "story" sounds pretentious and there I go with the quotes again. 
>
> Yes, my name was legitimately, legally "Semen". From the age of 3ish/4 to 11th grade. And every bully and teacher and substitute teacher knew it. No one told me I could get a lawyer let alone a lawyer would do the process of changing the name for free! My mom to this day thinks it wouldn't have been possible before 11th grade, for free anyway. And we were poor. Lower-lower class poor. 
> 
> Maybe a lawyer and court would've sympathized with a kid wanting to change his name from "Semen", maybe not. But of course, it shaped me. Into being the odd weird "semen" that I am today. In actuality, my name is Seamón<sup>$\text{\color{green}[1.]}$</sup> or Soema, or the Americanized: Sim'on or Shimon<sup>$\text{\color{green}[2.]}$</sup>. In Hebrew these names mean wisdom. In the Kabbalistic teachings, two types of wisdom: seeing as the complement to hearing, hearing as the complement to seeing. I think I mentioned this already. I won't rehash but something something new paragraph.
>
> Anyway, I like Sam. Because Sam in all the fantasies and mythos' of modern time means "innocence." "Samwell", "Samwise", "Sam". It means "this person has a wisdom, but from the good of his heart, not his intelligence." It means "this person is naive, but he has a good heart." I like the name Sam. "Shimon" means "this person is wise through his intelligence." It's true, but it's not me all the time as you know. I like "Sam" though.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

$\text{\color{green}[1.]:}$ I think "Siímyon" might be the best spelling.

$\text{\color{green}[2.]:}$ My Rabbi, who I hadn't met before 2022, actually told me this. He designated me as "Shimon," and told me that "Shimon" means "to hear" in Kabballic teachings. In Kabballic teachings, "to hear" is the complement to "to see." It's the second way of knowing. To hear is to understand, it's to fine out the meaning from the varied knowings, whereas "to see" is to know — it’s the sense or awareness of truth; no teaching needed. My mom being a music theory professor in Samarkand when I was born, I find it meaningful if this was my birth name, though really it had nothing to do with the Kabbalistic interpretation. My great-aunt’s late husband was named Siímyon. When my kindergarten teacher truncated my mistranslated name to "Sem," it became "Sam," which is also synchronistic to where I was born, Samarkand. I'm not gonna make a second-cumming pun though. The real twist about my name, has to do with my physics method, and my grandma's father, TBA (all the clues haven’t been left yet, but people can figure it out in a Jon-Snow type way when the remaining clues are specified).

### "Life ruined" post, entire-forum being deleted 5 months after I emailed it to the faculty/administrators 

Description [after having shown it to Niaz who commented in person about it (and to faculty/administrators), and writing BrokenWisdoms as a result of the depression and fear that came from losing my only description of those events, one I hadn’t backed up anywhere, with comments from others about having experienced similar things, the trauma of benzodiazepine addiction/coercion, and expressing extreme sympathy, and it was the top post in that for 4-ish years running]

### House on May St. 

Description

### Physics

Revelatory insights about the universe as a differentiable brain in my 2nd year, with that fascination returning to me regularly and intensely thereafter. Then in my 3rd/4th year, a 5-minute but-urgent/vivid/visceral conversation with my uncle (an optics physicist, about applying deep learning models to his work, involving optics, including behavior of light, for my PhD) just before — by chance — being put on the XRD (meaning, light diffraction) project by Chenliang, and, since being terminated, me coming up with a [unified wave theory](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Unified-Wave-Theory.md) (involving a differentiable, intelligence-optimizable, simulation/model of the universe) showing the agreement of my wave theory with measurement primarily through light multi-slit diffraction (analogous to XRD) experiments.
